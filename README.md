# iCWAS
## Introduction
iCWAS(immunoresponsive Cellome-Wide Association Study) is a strategy that transfers the GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) strategy to the cellular levels to evaluate associations between immune response assays and the cellular compositions of a large cohort, which can be derived at high resolution and low cost through integrating single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq via fine-grained deconvolution.
